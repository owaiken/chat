# Implementation Plan for Secure Chat Model Service

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adapting the Self-hosted AI Package to create a secure chat model service with the following features:
- Using a single Open Router API key for all users
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for data isolation
- Subscription model with three tiers
- Safe execution of Python scripts within predefined workflows

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Authentication & User Management
- Use Clerk for authentication and user management
- Integrate Clerk with Supabase using JWT verification

### 2. Database & Security
- Implement RLS policies in Supabase for:
  - Chat conversations
  - User files/documents
  - Python script executions
  - Usage tracking

### 3. API Proxy for Open Router
- Create a server-side proxy for Open Router API calls
- Implement rate limiting based on subscription tier
- Track token usage per user

### 4. Subscription Model
- Implement three subscription tiers using Stripe:
  - Standard ($5/month): Basic models, 100 messages/day
  - Pro ($50/month): Advanced models, 1,000 messages/day
  - Enterprise ($500/month): All models, custom limits

### 5. Python Script Safety
- Restrict Python script execution to predefined templates/apps
- Implement sandboxed execution environment
- Add approval workflow for custom scripts (Enterprise tier only)

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up Clerk authentication
2. Configure Supabase with RLS policies
3. Create API proxy for Open Router
4. Implement Stripe subscription integration
5. Develop sandboxed Python script execution
6. Deploy to Vercel for production

## Deployment Strategy
- Use Vercel for frontend and API routes
- Supabase for database and RLS
- Stripe for subscription management
